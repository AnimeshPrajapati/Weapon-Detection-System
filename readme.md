# 🔫 Weapon Detection using YOLOv8

This project implements a real-time weapon detection system using the **YOLOv8** object detection model. It identifies **guns and knives** in uploaded images and displays the results via a **Streamlit web interface**. Detection logs are stored in a **SQLite database** with timestamps for future reference.
